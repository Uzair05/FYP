                    Missing Motor Vehicles is a growing problem in urban cities that causes
                    several billions of dollars worth of damages <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_theft">[1]</a></sup>.
                    <br/>
                    As of current most, law enforcement departments in the world rely on traditional means of
                    finding and tracking down missing vehicles. These methods range from manually checking the
                    license plates of each vehicles in traffic stops and parking lots to relying on tips
                    from the community <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_theft">[1]</a></sup>.
                    <br/>
                    This project aims to create a system to automate the process of finding missing vehicles
                    and alerting law enforcement.

                    One of the means of tracking missing vehicles is by watching surveillance
                     footage of street cameras to try and track suspicious vehicles for clues.
                     But this is a very time-consuming and labor-intensive approach.
                    <br/>
                    As of current, we do not have a reliable system to automate the process
                     of watching surveillance footage. That is why this project aims at creating
                     a system to watch surveillance footage and trigger an alert whenever it manages
                     to find a reported missing vehicle.

                    The project aims to create a modular machine learning model that can watch surveillance
                     footage
